## Finally, available on [itch.io](hellbounce.itch.io/bob-the-man)!



#### If you like the game and want me to update it and bring the game somewhere, interact with me on itch.io.

#### There, you could find:
- The Dev log
- Screenshots
- Gameplay Videos
- Support the game
- And finally, download **Bob, the man**!

not sure if I'm going to work on it anymore, probably just gonna stick to UE5 and see what i could do
